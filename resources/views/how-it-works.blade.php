							<h2 class="font-weight-bold text-10 mb-4 appear-animation" data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="400">How to build a profitable email list</h2>
								<p class="custom-font-size-2 font-weight-light appear-animation" data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="600">The list is built from your audience. This entails collecting the names and emails of your followers, readers of your post and website visitors to make an email list. It allows you to send updates of new product launches, price slashes to subscribers of your list periodically and directly sell to them. research has shown that people maintain a given email throughout their lifetime. For instance, the email I am using was created many years ago in my secondary school days before facebook came into the scene. building your business around an email list helps create a long lasting relationship with subscribers  making them patronize you for life.  </p>
